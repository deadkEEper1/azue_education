Prepare PoC for pulling services data and keep it updated;


Pre steps:
1) Select preferable way to authenticate
    - Make it via auth flow
        Perfect. Need az-cli to install and login. After we are able to use API to retrieve data with authorized calls;

Steps:
1) Get Resources
    - Get all resources - done, but!!!
        I can see the result on getResources call. But it is not updated;
        Can not reproduce
2) Store subscription - TBD
3) Track ResourceChanges
    - track update - IS NOT WORKING. After i set new tag to storage account service => did not saw update in both GetResources
    AND GetResourceChanges(It needs time to store the changes)
    - track delete - DONE. We may see the delete event on ResourceChanges;


NOTES:
1) Needs to be careful, coz resourcesChanges.ids ARE lowerCased.
2) How to keep data valid
    - Keep using getResources interval
    - getResources as init script, trackUpdates later;
        Here is a possible issue i see. We can not simple merge resourceChanges with resource. All changes records has
        a not so easy to handle data structure. It can be posssible pain, and probably will be a need to parse every single object
        with special way. The script will be unrelieble, time consuming, with a high chances to bahave unexpected
   - GetResources as init call. Track created/updated events => Grab ids and GetResources by those id and store as it is;
